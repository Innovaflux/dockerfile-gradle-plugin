## Code of Conduct

By participating in Innovaflux projects, you agree to abide by
our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read and follow it to ensure
that Innovaflux remains a welcoming environment for everyone.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you encounter a bug, have a question, or want to request a feature:

1. **Search existing issues**: Check if the issue has already been reported or
   discussed.
2. **Open a new issue**: If you couldn't find an existing issue, feel free to
   create a new one. Please provide as much detail as possible, including steps
   to reproduce the problem or a description of the feature you'd like to see.

### Submitting Pull Requests

We welcome your pull requests to improve Innovaflux projects. Here's how you can
contribute:

1. **Fork the repository** and clone it locally.
2. **Create a new branch** based on the main branch for your feature or bug
   fix (e.g., `feature/add-new-component` or `bugfix/fix-typo`).
3. **Make your changes**. Follow
   our [development guidelines](#development-guidelines).
4. **Commit your changes** with a descriptive commit message (
   see [Commit Messages](#commit-messages)).
5. **Push the changes** to your fork.
6. **Submit a pull request** (PR) to the main repository.

- Ensure that your PR includes a clear description of the problem or feature and
  how your changes address it.
- Reference any relevant issues in your PR description (e.g., "Closes #123").

We will review your pull request and may ask for changes before it is merged.
Please be patient and responsive to feedback.

## Development Guidelines

### Coding Standards

All contributions must adhere to the coding standards for the project. This
includes:

- **Formatting**: Follow the project's code formatting rules. Most of our
  projects use `Prettier` for JavaScript/TypeScript and `Checkstyle` for
  Java-based repositories.
- **Linting**: Ensure your code passes the project's linter (`ESLint`, `PMD`,
  etc.).
- **Type Safety**: If you're working with strongly-typed languages (like
  TypeScript or Java), ensure all types are properly defined.

Please refer to the `README.md` or other documentation in each repository for
language-specific guidelines.

### Commit Messages

Write clear, concise commit messages that describe what the commit does. Use the
following format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]
[optional footer]
```

- **Type**: One of `feat` (feature), `fix` (bug fix), `docs` (documentation), `style` (formatting), `refactor`, `test`, or `chore`.
- **Scope**: The area of the codebase affected by this change (e.g., `auth`, `ui`, `build`).
- **Description**: A brief explanation of the change (use the imperative mood, e.g., "Add logging for server errors").
- **Body**: (optional) More detailed explanation of the change.
- **Footer**: (optional) References to issues or PRs, e.g., "Closes #123".

Example:

```
feat(auth): add support for OAuth2 login

This commit introduces OAuth2 login support for third-party services. It also updates the login UI to reflect new login methods.

Closes #123
```

### Testing

- Ensure your changes are covered by unit tests.
- If applicable, add integration or end-to-end tests.
- All tests should pass locally before submitting a pull request. We use CI to run tests, but it's important to verify them locally.
