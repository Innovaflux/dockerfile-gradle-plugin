# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

At Innovaflux, we take security issues seriously. If you find a security
vulnerability in any of our repositories, we encourage you to report it as soon
as possible. To ensure the safety of our users and projects, we request that you
follow the guidelines below:

### How to Report

- **Do not open a public issue** regarding the vulnerability. Instead, please
  report it confidentially via email to our security team at:
  **[security@innovaflux.com](mailto:security@innovaflux.com)**.
- Include as much detail as possible in your report, such as:
  - A description of the vulnerability.
  - Steps to reproduce the issue or proof of concept (PoC) code.
  - The potential impact of the vulnerability (e.g., how it can be exploited).
  - Any additional information that might help us resolve the issue more
    effectively.

### Response Time

- We aim to respond to security vulnerability reports within **48 hours** of
  receiving them.
- Once we acknowledge the issue, we will provide an estimated timeline for the
  resolution, and we will keep you updated on our progress.

### Security Patch Process

- Once a vulnerability is reported and confirmed, our team will prioritize the
  fix and work to release a patch as soon as possible.
- After the issue is resolved, we will publicly disclose the vulnerability along
  with the steps taken to address it. We will give credit to the reporter if
  they wish to be acknowledged.

### Supported Versions

We ensure security updates for the following versions of our projects:

| Version        | Supported |
|----------------|-----------|
| Latest         | ✅         |
| Older versions | ❌         |

If you are using an older, unsupported version, we strongly encourage you to
upgrade to the latest version.

### Confidentiality

We value your efforts in keeping our projects secure and will treat your
vulnerability report with the utmost confidentiality until a fix is released. We
kindly ask that you refrain from disclosing the vulnerability to the public
until we have had a chance to address it.

## Reporting Other Security Issues

If you come across any other security-related concerns (such as issues with our
infrastructure or website), please also report those directly
to [security@innovaflux.com](mailto:security@innovaflux.com). We appreciate all
efforts to improve the safety of our users and systems.

Thank you for helping keep Innovaflux secure!
